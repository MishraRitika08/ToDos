# ToDos
This application allows users to manage tasks by utilizing Solidity for the smart contract, MetaMask as the wallet, and Ganache for a local Ethereum blockchain. It has been developed using Tuffle framework along with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Adding Tasks:** Users can add tasks to the list.
- **Viewing Tasks:** Retrieve the list of pending tasks.
- **Deleting Tasks:** Remove specific completed tasks.
- **Clearing All Tasks:** Clear the entire task list.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Used for writing the smart contract.
- **MetaMask:** Integrated wallet for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain (Ganache).
- **Ganache:** Local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.
- **Truffle Framework:** Development framework.
- **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript:** Frontend development technologies.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`.

2. **Setup:**
